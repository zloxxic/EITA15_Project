//
// EDI610 Hardware Platform 2017 demo
//
// This application make use of the following devices of the hardware platform:
// 		-- Buttons Device
//		-- Seven Segment Controller
//		-- Interrupt Controller
//		-- VGA Controller
//		-- Keyboard Controller
//
//		The Buttons Device and Keyboard Controller are configured to generate interrupts.
//		Initially the screen is painted black with a blue bar at the top and a red bar at the
//		bottom. Then a single pixel is set to green. The coordinates of the green pixel is stored in
//		two global variables, x and y.
//
//		Once a new scan code is received from the keyboard the interrupt handler will check if
//		any of the arrow keys where pressed. If so the coordinates of the green pixel will be changed
//		according to the direction indicated by the arrow pressed. Note that the actual redrawing of
//		the green pixel is done in the main function. The purpose of this functionality is to demonstrate
//		how the VGA controller is used to draw things on a display.
//
//		Once any of the five pushbuttons is pressed or released an interrupt is generated. Each time
//		the interrupt handler for the buttons is executed a counter, bounceCounter, is incremented.
//		In the main function the value of bounceCounter is displayed on the seven segment displays.
//		The purpose of including this part is to demonstrate how to set up interrupts for the Buttons
//		Device. And also to highlight potential problems caused of button bouncing.
//
//		During the project you are free to make any modifications in the supplied code.
//
//		WARNING: Keep in mind that any new source file added to the project should be placed under the "src" folder.
//				 If you by mistake create a file in another folder:
//					1: Move the file to the "src" folder.
//					2: Delete "subdir.mk" located in the "Debug" folder.
